# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools and server-side scripts. It was created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl and has become one of the most popular platforms for building scalable network applications.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous & Event-Driven**: All APIs in Node.js are non-blocking, making it fast and efficient
- **Single-Threaded**: Uses event loop for handling multiple concurrent operations
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more
- **NPM**: Comes with npm (Node Package Manager) for easy package management
- **Large Ecosystem**: Access to thousands of open-source packages

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js from [official website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Verify installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## First Node.js Program

Create a simple Hello World program:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```
